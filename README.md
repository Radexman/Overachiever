# **Overachiever**

This web app is a SPA build with React, Taiwlind CSS and Daisy UI styled components library. I also used TypeScript here.

## **Overview**

Now this app sreves a couple of pourpouses, user can create various tasks, customize them and set the importance of each task. All of these actions are represented in the UI. Additionaly what separates this project from regular cookie cutter doto app is the statistics section where user can track their daily progress that they did by creating and compleating their tasks.

## **To Do**

- [x] Completed tasks state
- [ ] Notifications for important tasks
- [ ] About Page content
- [x] Stats Page content
- [x] Graphs and charts in Stats Page
- [ ] Daily reset for the tasks
- [ ] Add category icon
- [ ] Modal component
- [x] Add profile creation form
- [x] Create profile context

- [ ] Complete Day Feature - create button that cleares all states (start new day). Before all state is removed show popup with summary of all completed and not completed tasks.
